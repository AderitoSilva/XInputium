This file contains a simple log of new added features and fixed bugs
and issues, so they can be listed for the next release.


-------------------------------
NEW FEATURES / IMPROVEMENTS
-------------------------------
Added `CurrentStateDuration` and `PreviousStateDuration` properties to `ActivationInputEvent` and `ActivationInputEventArgs` classes. These make it easier to create events that perform time-based actions.


-------------------------------
BUG FIXES:
-------------------------------
FIXED - Fixed a bug with `XInputDevice.GetState` method, where it was performing a division by 32768 instead of 32767, causing a very small imprecision in positive joystick axes' values.
FIXED - Fixed some documentation misspells.
