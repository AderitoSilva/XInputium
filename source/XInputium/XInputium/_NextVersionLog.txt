This file contains a simple log of new added features and fixed bugs
and issues, so they can be listed for the next release.


-------------------------------
NEW FEATURES / IMPROVEMENTS
-------------------------------
Added `CurrentStateDuration` and `PreviousStateDuration` properties to `ActivationInputEvent` and `ActivationInputEventArgs` classes. These make it easier to create events that perform time-based actions.
Added two new trigger modes to `ActivationInputEvent` — the `WhileActive` and `Never` trigger modes. `WhileActive` trigger mode gives developers the ability to get notified on each input loop while a specific condition is active.
Added the new `TriggerMode` property to `ActivationInputEventArgs` class, to make it easier for event handlers to determine how the event is being triggered.


-------------------------------
BUG FIXES:
-------------------------------
FIXED - Fixed a bug with `XInputDevice.GetState` method, where it was performing a division by 32768 instead of 32767, causing a very small imprecision in positive joystick axes' values.
FIXED - Fixed some documentation misspells.
